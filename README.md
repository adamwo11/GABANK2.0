# Bugs

    - if you click withdraw/deposit and there is $0 in your balance it returns NaN and is now unfixable
    - Can add a card without putting anything in the inputs

# Future features

    - i would like to add transfer features, where users can transfer balance through cards and eventually other users
    - Delete and update for the cards
    - when a user adds a card if its a known card it will show a picture of the card
    - Deployed aswell
